        <h1>IBN is an open alternative to Roadrunner News, <br> bringing accurate and updated information to every student.</h1>
        <h2 id="about">Run by former members of Roadrunner News, IBN is a new platform dedicated to delivering accurate, up-to-date, and trustworthy information to students.
            <br>
            Recognizing the significance of segments and insignificance of others, we've chosen to focus on providing the news and information that students wanted in the first place.
            <br>
            To achieve this, we assembled a strong team to work on the episodes of IBN. Who exactly is on this team? That will remain a mystery for now.
